# DMRC MetroGuide  

This repository contains a **C++ implementation of a Metro Guide System** that provides users with tools to navigate a fictional metro network. It offers features to find the shortest path between stations, minimize interchanges, and display a list of metro stations along with interchange information.


## Features  
- **Shortest Path Finder**: Quickly find the shortest path between two metro stations.  
- **Minimum Interchange Finder**: Identify a route with the least number of interchanges.  
- **Metro Station List**: Display a list of all metro stations and their interchanges for easy reference.  


## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or any IDE with C++ support).  

### Installation Steps  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DMRC-MetroGuide.git
   cd DMRC-MetroGuide
   ```  
2. Compile the code:  
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o MetroGuide
   ```  
3. Run the executable:  
   ```bash
   ./MetroGuide
   ```  

## Usage  

Once you run the program, you'll be presented with a menu containing the following options:  
1. **Find Path from Source to Destination**  
   - Enter the starting and destination stations to calculate either:  
     - The shortest path based on distance.  
     - The path with the minimum number of interchanges.  

2. **Display List of All Stations with Interchanges**  
   - View all metro stations along with the details of interchange stations.  

3. **Exit**  
   - Exit the program.
